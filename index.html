    <h2>Jeremy Chronister</h2>

    <p>I grew up in southcentral Pennsylvania and went to college at the University of Maine. After graduating college with a degree in Chemical Engineering I took a job at a paper mill in western Maryland. There are many different processes involved with making paper and several are very interesting. I mainly worked in the pulp mill which converts wood chips to white pulp which is then used to make paper products.</p>

    <p>Paper is a dying industry and there were signs that the future of the mill was in jeopardy so I relocated the family, (which had grown to a wife, three girls and two dogs), to another pulp mill in southeast Tennessee. Prior to moving I thought the new mill had lots of potential but was disappointed once I started working there. After about a year, a different part of the plant which produced newsprint shutdown and I started to think about switching industries. I was introduced to programming while working so I went back to school to learn software development.</p>
